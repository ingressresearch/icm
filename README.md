Ingress Change Monitor

Source code of a website monitoring Ingress players' activity.

Obviously this work isn't affiliated with Niantic, Google, or Ingress. In fact is has nothing to do with anything anyone else has done.

Sorry, not much documentation and the code is very rough, I wasn't planning to make it available. Essentially:
*.sh files are batch files updating the data.
index.php is the entry point for the site.

The rest of the files creates pages that are obvious from their name.
